# Human Chess Bot

A chess bot that plays like a human using the **Maia neural network** and **research-based thinking time simulation**. Designed for Chess.com and Lichess.org.

## The Problem with Chess Bots

Traditional chess bots (like Stockfish) are easily detected because:
- They play perfect moves instantly or with fixed delays
- Their timing patterns are inhuman (consistent, predictable)
- Move selection is superhuman (always optimal)

**Result:** Most bots get banned within a few games.

## Our Solution: Human Mode

This bot solves detection in two ways:

### 1. Maia Neural Network for Human-Like Moves

[Maia](https://maiachess.com/) is a neural network trained on millions of human games at specific ELO ratings (1100-1900). Instead of finding the "best" move, Maia predicts **what a human of that rating would actually play** - including the natural mistakes and suboptimal choices humans make.

### 2. Research-Based Thinking Time Simulation

**This is the critical innovation.** Using Maia alone still resulted in bans within 4 games. After implementing research-based thinking times, **we achieved 130+ games without detection.**

Our thinking time model is based on analysis of **12+ million Lichess games** and academic psychology research:

| Research Finding | Implementation |
|-----------------|----------------|
| **21.26% of moves are premoves** | Premove probability system with context awareness |
| **Inverted U-curve timing** | Opening fast → Middlegame slow → Endgame fast |
| **Log-normal distribution** | Heavy-tailed sampling (NOT Gaussian) |
| **Move correlation (AR(1), ρ=0.4)** | Each move's time depends on previous move |
| **ELO-based variability** | SD = a + b × Mean (coefficients vary by rating) |
| **Context-aware adjustments** | Recaptures, forced moves, complexity factors |

```
Think Time Formula:
├── Base time from game phase (inverted U-curve)
├── × Complexity factor (legal moves, captures, checks)
├── × Move type modifier (recaptures, forced moves, castling)
├── × Time control scaling (blitz/rapid)
├── + Move correlation (40% weight from previous move)
└── → Sample from log-normal distribution
```

## Features

### Human Mode (Recommended)
- **Maia ELO Selection**: Choose your simulated rating (1100-1900)
- **Time Control Modes**: Blitz or Rapid timing profiles
- **Realistic Mistakes**: Plays like a human, not a superhuman
- **Natural Timing**: Indistinguishable from human players

### Stockfish Mode (High Detection Risk)
- Traditional Stockfish engine (skill levels 0-20)
- Configurable depth, memory, and CPU threads
- **Warning**: High detection risk on Chess.com

### Other Features
- **Non-Stop Matches**: Automatically queues new games after each match
- **Manual Mode**: Press hotkey to see best move, play it yourself
- **Evaluation Display**: Real-time position evaluation and WDL percentages
- **Accuracy Tracking**: Bot accuracy vs opponent accuracy statistics
- **Move Overlay**: Visual arrow showing suggested moves
- **Modern Dark UI**: Clean PyQt6 interface with card-based layout

## Supported Platforms

## Usage

### Starting the Bot

```bash
# Windows
run.bat
# or
venv\Scripts\python.exe src\gui_pyqt.py

# Linux
./run.sh
# or
venv/bin/python3 src/gui_pyqt.py
```

### Quick Start

1. Click **"Auto Download"** to install Stockfish (or **"Select"** to choose existing)
2. Click **"Open Browser"** - Chrome opens to your selected chess site
3. Navigate to a live match
4. **Enable Human Mode** (toggle in settings)
5. Configure Maia ELO and time control
6. Click **"Start"** or press **1**

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **1** | Start bot |
| **2** | Stop bot |
| **3** | Make move (manual mode only) |

### Human Mode Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Maia ELO** | Simulated player rating (1100-1900). Higher = stronger but still human-like |
| **Time Control** | Affects thinking times: Blitz (faster) or Rapid (slower, more deliberate) |
| **Use GPU** | Enable for faster inference if you have a compatible GPU |

### Non-Stop Matches

Enable **"Non-Stop Matches"** to automatically:
1. Detect game completion
2. Click "New Game" button
3. Wait for opponent
4. Start playing the next game

Tested for **133+ consecutive games** without manual intervention.

## Technical Details

### Thinking Time Research

The thinking time model implements findings from:
- **Lichess Database Analysis**: 12+ million games analyzed for timing patterns
- **Psychology Research**: Human decision-making under time pressure
- **Premove Studies**: When and why humans premove

Key parameters:
```python
# Premove probability
base_premove_prob = 0.2126  # 21.26% from research

# Move correlation
rho = 0.4  # AR(1) autocorrelation coefficient

# ELO-based variability (SD = a + b * Mean)
# Low ELO:  a=0.1, b=0.91
# High ELO: a=0.6, b=1.36

# Time control scaling
time_scales = {"bullet": 0.4, "blitz": 1.0, "rapid": 2.5}
```

## Results

### Detection Avoidance

| Configuration | Games Before Ban |
|--------------|------------------|
| Stockfish (raw) | ~1-2 games |
| Maia only | ~4 games |
| **Maia + Thinking Times** | **133+ games (no ban)** |

The research-based thinking time simulation is the key differentiator. Without it, even human-like moves get flagged due to timing patterns.

### Accuracy Metrics

In Human Mode, the bot achieves realistic accuracy scores:
- **Bot Accuracy**: Compared against Stockfish's best move
- **Opponent Accuracy**: Tracked for reference
- Both displayed in real-time in the UI
